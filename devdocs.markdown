# Dev Docs

This is just a notebook of shit I'm reading / learning about when I am working on this

- libssh appears to support ED25519, even though it's not listed on the front page: 
  http://git.libssh.org/projects/libssh.git/tree/doc/curve25519-sha256@libssh.org.txt
- libssh docs are incomplete; you'll want to get the source and be able to reference it
- was looking on GitHub, but apparently this is wrong: https://github.com/nviennot/libssh/
- official repos are here: http://git.libssh.org/
